# Project Story: CosyTrades

## The Vision
In a world of noisy, gamified trading apps designed to trigger dopamine and encourage over-trading, **CosyTrades** stands apart as a sanctuary for the serious discretionary trader. It is not a casino; it is a home.

We are building a "cozy, desktop-first" environment where the noise of the market is filtered out, leaving only signal, process, and reflection. It is for the trader who knows that *they* are the edge, not the chart. It feels like a warm, personal study where everything has its place.

## The User
Our user is a discretionary swing trader. They don't need 100 indicators or sub-millisecond execution. They need clarity. They buy quality names when they are oversold. They have a system, but they struggle with the psychology of sticking to it. They use brokers like Trading212 or eToro, but they feel these platforms lack the analytical depth and psychological support needed for professional growth.

## The Experience
Imagine walking into a clean, well-lit room. There is a desk, a journal, and a wise mentor sitting in the corner.
- **The Desk (The Canvas)**: A fully customizable workspace. You decide what's on your desk. A watchlist? A journal? A summary of today's P&L? It's your room, arrange it how you think best.
- **The Journal**: A place to record not just numbers, but feelings. "Why did I take this trade?" "How did I feel when it went against me?"
- **The Mentor (Jarvis)**: An AI companion that knows you better than you know yourself. It doesn't just answer questions; it proactively nudges you towards better habits. "You're breaking your rule about max risk," it might whisper. Or, "This looks like a revenge trade. Take a walk."

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Process over Outcome**: A losing trade followed by good process is a win. A winning trade with bad process is a loss.
2.  **Calm over Hype**: Design should lower heart rate, not raise it.
3.  **Reflection over Reaction**: The market will be there tomorrow. Understand what happened today.

## Success Metrics
- **User Clarity**: Does the user feel more in control?
- **Rule Adherence**: Is the user breaking fewer of their own rules?
- **Journaling Consistency**: Is the user logging their thoughts regularly?
